Literature, as the great Canadian critic Northrop Frye observed, grows out of other literature; we should not be surprised to find, then, that it also looks like other literature. As you read, it may pay to remember this: there’s no such thing as a wholly original work of literature. Once you know that, you can go looking for old friends and asking the attendant question: “now where have I seen her before?”

This dialogue between old texts and new is always going on at one level or another. Critics speak of this dialogue as intertextuality, the ongoing interaction between poems or stories. This intertextual dialogue deepens and enriches the reading experience, bringing multiple layers of meaning to the text, some of which readers may not even consciously notice. The more we become aware of the possibility that our text is speaking to other texts, the more similarities and correspondences we begin to notice, and the more alive the text becomes. We’ll come back to this discussion later, but for now we’ll simply note that newer works are having a dialogue with older ones, and they often indicate the presence of this conversation by invoking the older texts with anything from oblique references to extensive quotations.

I began to cry. This was the crux of things, I realized: crying is always a sign you’ve found the fear at the heart of the matter. What was wrong with the muck and mire and aimlessness? It symbolized this sense of disorientation and disconnection. Where was my faith? My trust? In truth there is nothing missing, nothing wrong. There is just this, just as it is. I cried painfully for a while.

Nothing needed to be confusing. Confusion implies I am resisting not knowing. Allow that I cannot know. There is Unknowable Mystery and nothing I can do can capture it. Allow Mystery and then there is no confusion. Wanting a map of the territory is clinging to wanting to label experiences and about being uncomfortable with not knowing.

Moreover, it now seemed evident that epiphanies were typically accompanied by the same reactions: a sense of finality, a sense of ones life having led to this great moment, feelings of deep freedom, bliss, wonder and relaxation. The feeling of meaningfulness in epiphanies seemed common; but it also seemed clear that that sense of meaning arose from personal conceptualizations.

The quest for security is doomed, and its failure is what makes it interesting. It’s like taking certain drugs, say, or skipping classes at university or gambling in casinos-it’s so bad for you that it feels cool; it gives you a sense of wealth since you are squandering life as if you were immortal.

If we regard the father as insignificant, ridiculous, absurd, in the fashionably American way, we have diminished him so far that there is no longer a place for him in the story. If we insist he was an evil person, who shamed us all the time, we fall into victimhood and there is no longer a place for us in the story.

Rilke says: I am too alone in the world, and not alone enough to make every moment holy. I am too tiny in this world, and not tiny enough just to lie before you like a thing, shrewd and secretive. I want my own will, and I want simply to be with my will, as it goes toward action, and in the silent, sometimes hardly moving times when something is coming near, I want to be with those who know secret things or else alone. Translated by R.B.

The Law stands for the commandments we need in order to stay alive, the rule that says which side of the road we drive on, the law of gravity. We need to learn the axiom that we cannot take water into our lungs and keep breathing; the dictate that keeps us from murdering each other over a slight rebuke; the canon against self-slaughter; the postulates that encourage prudence, politeness, and appropriateness; the precepts that help us control our madness. Some men stay with the rules.

Only when a man’s interior warriors are strong enough can he go into the joy of display. With this strength he can also enter into the delight of form. Shapeless clothing, verse that is sloppy, chaotic furnishings: all are linked in secret ways to shame. The universe is not ashamed, and it delights in form. The sun rising over the ocean and setting in the ocean, the moon’s lonely shinings and hidings, the leaves unfolding and falling are its displays.

What we make of our life—the sum total of thoughts, emotions, words, and actions that fill the brief interval between birth and death—is our one great creative masterpiece. The beauty and significance of a life well lived consists not in the works we leave behind, or in what history has to say about us. It comes from the quality of conscious experience that infuses our every waking moment, and from the impact we have on others.

At some point in the evening Dellarobia had stopped being amazed that Ovid had turned into someone new, and understood he had become himself, in the presence of his wife. With the sense of a great weight settling, she recognized marriage. Not the precarious risk she’d balanced for years against forbidden fruits, something easily lost in a brittle moment by flying away or jumping a train to ride off on someone else’s steam. She was not about to lose it. She’d never had it.

Learning to see what has been hidden from you carries the thrill of secret knowledge. It’s also practical knowledge. It helps you understand when you feel graceful and when you feel awkward as you share spaces and moments with people you don’t know. It helps you pull yourself into a transformed social landscape, one that is open and rich with surprising, fleeting, affirming connections. And using this precious and practical knowledge can inch us all toward a more intriguing, respectful, tolerant world.

He never spoke with any bitterness at all, no matter how awful the things he said. Are there really people without resentment, without hate? she wondered. People who never go cross-grained to the universe? Who recognize evil, and resist evil, and yet are utterly unaffected by it? Of course there are. Countless, the living and the dead. Those who have returned in pure compassion to the wheel, those who follow the way that cannot be followed without knowing they follow it, the sharecropper’s wife in Alabama and the lama in Tibet and the entomologist in Peru and the millworker in Odessa and the greengrocer in London and the goatherd in Nigeria and the old, old man sharpening a stick by a dry streambed somewhere in Australia, and all the others.

You are afraid of losing your balance. But change need not unbalance you; life’s not a static object, after all. It’s a process. There’s no holding still. Intellectually you know that, but emotionally you refuse it. Nothing remains the same from one moment to the next, you can’t step into the same river twice. Life—evolution—the whole universe of space/time, matter/energy—existence itself—is essentially change.” “That is one aspect of it,” Orr said. “The other is stillness.”

WHEN I TEACH a beginning class, it is good. I have to come back to beginner’s mind, the first way I thought and felt about writing. In a sense, that beginner’s mind is what we must come back to every time we sit down and write. There is no security, no assurance that because we wrote something good two months ago, we will do it again. Actually, every time we begin, we wonder how we ever did it before. Each time is a new journey with no maps.

Quentin nodded—he couldn’t quite talk yet. He felt full of love for that little boy he’d once been, innocent and naive, as yet unscuffed and unmarred by everything that was to come. He was such a ridiculous, vulnerable little person, with so many strenuous disappointments and wonders ahead of him. Quentin hadn’t thought of him in years. He wasn’t that boy anymore, that boy was lost long ago. He’d become a man instead, one of those crude, weather-beaten, shopworn things, and he’d almost forgotten he’d ever been anything else—he’d had to forget, to survive growing up. But now he wished he could reassure that child and take care of him. He wished he could tell him that none of it was going to turn out anything like the way he hoped, but that everything was going to be all right anyway. It was hard to explain, but he would see.

But I will not expect of him that he understand my values, my expectations for myself and those I love, my spiritual nature, or my philosophy of life. That is not what he is trained for and that is not what he will be good at. It is not what drives those engines of his excellence.

I am one of the latter, and I suspect I am in the majority. What I hope, unfortunately, is not what I expect.

All this was part of the “deep story.” In that story, strangers step ahead of you in line, making you anxious, resentful, and afraid. A president allies with the line cutters, making you feel distrustful, betrayed. A person ahead of you in line insults you as an ignorant redneck, making you feel humiliated and mad. Economically, culturally, demographically, politically, you are suddenly a stranger in your own land. The whole context of Louisiana—its companies, its government, its church and media—reinforces that deep story.

Looking back at my previous research, I see that the scene had been set for Trump’s rise, like kindling before a match is lit. Three elements had come together. Since 1980, virtually all those I talked with felt on shaky economic ground, a fact that made them brace at the very idea of “redistribution.” They also felt culturally marginalized: their views about abortion, gay marriage, gender roles, race, guns, and the Confederate flag all were held up to ridicule in the national media as backward. And they felt part of a demographic decline; “there are fewer and fewer white Christians like us,” Madonna had told me. They’d begun to feel like a besieged minority. And to these feelings they added the cultural tendency—described by W.J. Cash in The Mind of the South, though shared in milder form outside the South—to identify “up” the social ladder with the planter, the oil magnate, and to feel detached from those further down the ladder.

Trump allowed them both to feel like a good moral American and to feel superior to those they considered “other” or beneath them. This giddy, validating release produced a kind of “high” that felt good. And of course people wanted to feel good. The desire to hold on to this elation became a matter of emotional self-interest.

When disagreement comes from a socially different person, we are prompted to work harder. Diversity jolts us into cognitive action in ways that homogeneity simply does not.

In Brief (Katherine W. Phillips)
- Your Highlight on Location 80-85 | Added on Thursday, May 11, 2017 7:47:57 AM

Members of a homogeneous group rest somewhat assured that they will agree with one another; that they will understand one another's perspectives and beliefs; that they will be able to easily come to a consensus. But when members of a group notice that they are socially different from one another, they change their expectations. They anticipate differences of opinion and perspective. They assume they will need to work harder to come to a consensus. This logic helps to explain both the upside and the downside of social diversity: people work harder in diverse environments both cognitively and socially. They might not like it, but the hard work can lead to better outcomes.

In the words of medical sociologist Arthur Frank: “People tell stories not just to work out their own changing identities, but also to guide others who will follow them. They seek not to provide a map that can guide others—each must create his own—but rather to witness the experience of reconstructing one’s own map.”

“Try to choose carefully, Arren, when the great choices must be made. When I was young, I had to choose between the life of being and the life of doing. And I leapt at the latter like a trout to a fly. But each deed you do, each act, binds you to itself and to its consequences, and makes you act again and yet again. Then very seldom do you come upon a space, a time like this, between act and act, when you may stop and simply be. Or wonder who, after all, you are.”

Arren was silent, pondering this. Presently the mage said, speaking softly, “Do you see, Arren, how an act is not, as young men think, like a rock that one picks up and throws, and it hits or misses, and that’s the end of it. When that rock is lifted, the earth is lighter; the hand that bears it heavier. When it is thrown, the circuits of the stars respond, and where it strikes or falls the universe is changed. On every act the Balance of the Whole depends. The winds and seas, the powers of water and earth and light, all that these do, and all that the beasts and green things do, is well done, and rightly done. All these act within the Equilibrium. From the hurricane and the great whale’s sounding to the fall of a dry leaf and the gnat’s flight, all they do is done within the Balance of the Whole. But we, insofar as we have power over the world and over one another, we must learn to do what the leaf and the whale and the wind do of their own nature. We must learn to keep the Balance. Having intelligence, we must not act in ignorance. Having choice, we must not act without responsibility. Who am I—though I have the power to do it—to punish and reward, playing with men’s destinies?”

“Aye, I know what they think they seek. But I know it to be a lie. Listen to me, Arren. You will die. You will not live forever. Nor will any man nor anything. Nothing is immortal. But only to us is it given to know that we must die. And that is a great gift: the gift of selfhood. For we have only what we know we must lose, what we are willing to lose. . . . That selfhood which is our torment, and our treasure, and our humanity, does not endure. It changes; it is gone, a wave on the sea. Would you have the sea grow still and the tides cease, to save one wave, to save yourself? Would you give up the craft of your hands, and the passion of your heart, and the light of sunrise and sunset, to buy safety for yourself—safety forever?

But I’m not certain of anything any more. It’s like one of those dreams that changes you.

Had Romeo been told by Juliet that she would appear at her window at noon, the young Veronan’s rapture at the appointed hour could not have matched the Count’s. Had Dr. Stahlbaum’s children—Fritz and Clara—been told on Christmas morning that the drawing-room doors would be opened at midday, their elation could not have rivaled the Count’s upon the sounding of the first toll.

While William James wrote about attention as though it were one single entity, science now tells us the concept refers not just to one ability but to many. Among them: Selective attention, the capacity to focus on one element and ignore others. Vigilance, maintaining a constant level of attention as time goes on. Allocating attention so we notice small or rapid shifts in what we experience. Goal focus, or “cognitive control,” keeping a specific goal or task in mind despite distractions. Meta-awareness, being able to track the quality of one’s own awareness—for example, noticing when your mind wanders or you’ve made a mistake.

4. Does the current culture of increasing divisiveness affect our quest for true belonging? If so, how? What emerged from the responses to these questions were four elements of true belonging. These elements are situated in the reality of the world we live in today. The theories that emerge from this methodology are based on how we engage with the world in our everyday lives; they’re not hypothetical. This means you can’t develop a theory on true belonging without addressing how our increasingly polarized world shapes our lives and our experiences of connection and true belonging. I didn’t intend to write a book about belonging set against a backdrop of political and ideological chaos. But that’s not my call to make. My job is to be true to the data. As you take a look at each of the four elements, you can see that each is a daily practice and feels like a paradox. They’re going to challenge us: 1. People Are Hard to Hate Close Up. Move In. 2.

I believe, and tell my students, one of the most courageous things to say in an uncomfortable conversation is “Tell me more.” Exactly when we want to turn away and change the topic, or just end the conversation, or counter, as you say, we also have the opportunity to ask what else we need to know to fully understand the other person’s perspective. Help me understand why this is so important to you, or help me understand why you don’t agree with a particular idea. And then we have to listen. Really listen. Listen to understand, not about agreeing or disagreeing. We have to listen to understand in the same way we want to be understood.

True belonging is the spiritual practice of believing in and belonging to yourself so deeply that you can share your most authentic self with the world and find sacredness in both being a part of something and standing alone in the wilderness. True belonging doesn’t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are.

True belonging doesn’t require you to change who you are; it requires you to be who you are. And we feel the pull here again in our practices: People are hard to hate close up. Move in.

The mark of a wild heart is earned in the wilderness, but there is also a daily practice that I learned from this that is critical to our quest for true belonging. This practice changed how I show up in my life, the way I parent, and the way I lead: Stop walking through the world looking for confirmation that you don’t belong. You will always find it because you’ve made that your mission. Stop scouring people’s faces for evidence that you’re not enough. You will always find it because you’ve made that your goal. True belonging and self-worth are not goods; we don’t negotiate their value with the world. The truth about who we are lives in our hearts. Our call to courage is to protect our wild heart against constant evaluation, especially our own. No one belongs here more than you.

In this context, then, how do we practice an outlook in which there is nothing to hold on to without being trapped by our own words and ideas? It all comes down to this: as soon as I recognize that I am engaged in thinking, I have already returned. Now all I need to do is rest right there. Some people find that pausing for a breath helps to break the momentum of the train of thinking. Others find that focusing on the breath is more of an interruption. The key point is just to recognize and rest. In the same way, as soon as I recognize that I am explaining or describing to myself what I am experiencing, I rest. When I become aware of that I am hoping, fearing or dreading, I return and rest. If I think that I see, understand, feel or know something, I return and rest. Whenever I notice that I am bored, elated, depressed or flooded with feelings of well-being, I return and rest. And if I find that I am wondering about where all this is going, I return and rest.

Resting is important. In the context of great completion practice, resting is not just physical resting. It includes letting the heart rest — letting ourselves feel all the different emotions surging within us and not try to resolve them. Resting includes letting our minds rest, too — letting the stream of thoughts and stories play itself out. There are still deeper levels of resting, and one of the purposes of many energy-transformation practices is to make it possible for us to rest even more deeply. Resting helps to create the conditions in which emotional reactivity can resolve itself — leading to a refinement of energy in the whole system. It also allows energy channels to open so that energy can circulate smoothly. And it makes it possible for us to listen to our whole system and sense imbalances before they become serious problems.

Nevertheless, there is a difference in emphasis between these two practices. In mahamudra, the emphasis is on no distraction. In dzogchen, the emphasis is on relaxing and opening. Relaxation and no distraction are both essential, but part of the difference in flavor between the two is this difference in emphasis.

Over fifty years ago, D. T. Suzuki’s Essays in Zen Buddhism 3 struck a chord in me. They awoke a feeling and a yearning that I could not put into words. The reverberations of that chord led me to abandon a career in mathematics and journey to India where I met my principal teacher Kalu Rinpoche. The reverberations did not stop there. Later, Thomas Merton’s The Wisdom of the Desert, 4 a compendium of anecdotes and sayings from the early Christian anchorites in the Egyptian deserts, set off reverberations with another chord. The common theme was a resonance with a certain kind of awareness — a knowing that was vitally important to me, more important than what I did with my life. Why did I and why do I pursue that knowing? In the end, it is simply because this knowing calls to me. In traditional Buddhism, this knowing is presented as nirvana, enlightenment, freedom, awakening, the end of suffering or any number of other promises. For me, those words now ring hollow. I think I believed them at one point, but I am not sure. The call of that knowing, however, has never been in doubt, and it still calls.

Great Completion (Tib. rdzogs chen, pron. dzogchen) is a tradition of meditation practices based on the principle that a timeless awareness is present in every moment of experience, or, to put it another way, that every moment of experience is simultaneously a moment of timeless awareness and that every such moment is complete in and of itself. Following a teaching from Garab Dorje (Tib. dga’ rab rdo rje,) 10 the Indian progenitor of the Great Completion tradition, the task of the practitioner is threefold: to recognize timeless awareness in each and every experience; to be in touch with that timeless awareness whatever he or she is experiencing; and to trust that all thinking or confusion resolves itself in that timeless awareness.

If you are reading this book, you probably have a good bit of practice experience already. I suggest you read one or two verse commentaries at a time and see what resonates in you. Read them with a quiet, open mind. When you feel a shift, let it work inside you. Put the book down and rest right there, if only for a moment or two. When you sit down to practice, you may recall that shift. Do not think about what you have just read. That is just distraction. Do not try to go back to the shift or duplicate it. Simply rest in its echoes — in your body and your mind. In this way, these words may lead you into unknown territory, territory that is inaccessible to the conceptual mind. Where that may take you, what may become of you, I have no idea. I can, however, say this: no matter what the difficulties, no matter what the challenges, if you listen deeply to what calls to you in these pages and go where it leads you, I doubt very much that you will have any regrets.

When you sit down to practice, you may recall that shift. Do not think about what you have just read. That is just distraction. Do not try to go back to the shift or duplicate it. Simply rest in its echoes — in your body and your mind. In this way, these words may lead you into unknown territory, territory that is inaccessible to the conceptual mind.

We need to be ready for pointing-out instructions. If not, we end up looking at nothing but do not see nothing. Instead, we do not see anything and fall into a kind of dullness, a dullness that we then take as a basis for meditation. Because we are unable to describe our experience, we may understand this dullness as “inexpressible and inconceivable,” but there is no vitality, no power in it. Thoughts and feelings are just dulled, as if they were experienced in a fog. Because they do not disturb us, we think our practice is in good shape. People who are prone to depression easily fall into this state, a dull stasis that goes nowhere except to a gradually increasing torpor and immobility. This state of mind is often called groundhog meditation because, like a groundhog that sleeps through the winter, one can rest in this dull state for long periods of time. Every text on direct-awareness practice includes warnings about it.

Whatever the form of dullness, there is still a wakefulness in it. When we look at nothing and we have no sense of seeing, then we look at what experiences nothing. As Mipham writes in A Light in the Dark: 27 Now, as you experience this vague knowing in which there is no thought or movement, look at what knows that this is happening, look at what is mentally or emotionally inert, and rest there. If we do this, there comes a day when we do see nothing, and everything changes. Verse 3.5 Some who know that movement and memory are mind Mull over the traces as thoughts and feelings ebb and flow: They track the arising and fading of thinking.

Mind is not a thing we watch. If we are watching mind, we are already one step removed. If we are trying to change what we our experiencing, or trying to analyze or track it, we are more than one step removed. Every movement — whether it is checking our experience, managing it or anticipating it (goal-seeking) — stirs up the water that is our mind, along with all the sediment. The empty clarity is there, but we will not know it as long as we keep stirring things up.

Now just sit there and do nothing. Thoughts arise, of course, and some of them will catch you. I use the word catch because, when thoughts arise, I do not decide which ones I will follow and which ones I will just experience coming and going. Some thoughts, feelings and sensations simply come and go on their own and cause no disturbance. Others catch me and I fall into distraction. Which does which is not something I control. As soon as I recognize that I have been distracted, I am already back. There is nothing more to do but start again. A puff of wind, the sound of a siren, the pattern of light and shadow in front of me — they catch me. When I recognize that I have been caught, I am back and start again. Last night’s dinner with friends, a harsh word to or from my partner, a mistake at work, a pat on the back — these also catch me. I come back and start again. I feel inadequate, that I should be doing more — I come back and start again. I am enjoying the feeling of peace — I come back and start again. Clarity or dullness, bliss or pain, no thoughts or madhouse, duality or non-duality, emptiness or fullness, whatever experience catches me, I come back and start again. Any feeling that I am finally getting somewhere, any feelings of pride, achievement, relief, joy, awe, or devotion — I come back and start again. As my mind settles, something else begins to happen. I experience the play of emotional reactions — thoughts, feelings and associations — just coming and going. Specific thoughts, feelings and sensations catch me less frequently, even when they are powerful or intense. It is a bit strange to sit utterly at peace while my whole being seethes with anger, or to be completely at peace while I am feeling cut to the core by how someone has treated me. The intensity of the feeling suggests that there should be more disturbance, but the wonder is that it is possible to be completely at peace in powerful feelings and experiences, positive or negative, without being disturbed or distracted and without suppressing or controlling them. Bit by bit, I can let experiences of emptiness, transcendence or immanence come and go, too. They tend to catch me in a different way because, as Alexander Pope says, “Hope springs eternal in the human breast…” 12

Even today, whether people live close to the earth or in high-rise apartments, death is a deep spring. For many of us, this spring has been parched of its mystery. And yet we have an intuition that a fragment of eternity within us is liberated at the time of death. This intuition calls us to bear witness—to apprehend a part of ourselves, which has perhaps been hidden and silent.

Not to consciously choose a path guarantees that our psyche will choose for us, and depression or illness of one form or another will result. Yet to move into unfamiliar territory activates anxiety as our constant comrade.

was a bully, given to verbal and physical abuse of his spouses. Others, giving up on the notion of gaining power overtly, resort to what we commonly identify as “passive/aggressive” behaviors. Such a person appears to cooperate, even be congenial, but surreptitiously sabotages, turns up late, inserts the chilling, critical remark, fails to carry through, and thereby gains power through apparent powerlessness. Somerset Maugham’s short story “Louise” dramatizes a woman who presents herself as an invalid in order to control others. Every time they act independently, she has a heart spell, and yanks their chain. Fragile soul that she is, she runs through two husbands who precede her into mortality, and finally, after her daughter’s long acquiescence ends with her deciding to marry and move out, Louise has the last word by dying for real. We can only imagine how her daughter’s life will continue to be psychologically dominated by this passive-aggressive, controlling ghost. Such logical controlling behaviors, based on early and overly generalized conclusions, can come to not only dominate our lives, but also hurt those around us. Thirdly,

The first category of response to the insufficiency of nurturing derives from the magical thinking of the child (“I am as I am treated”). For some, the absence of the supportive other is internalized as “I am not met halfway because I am not worth being met.” Such a person has a tendency to hide out from life, diminish personal possibilities, avoid risk, and even make self-sabotaging choices.

REMEMBER THAT EACH OF THESE six patterns of response, to overwhelmment and insufficiency, may be found in each of us, though in widely varying degrees of prominence and autonomy in our lives, and each is frequently called upon in turn by differing external stimuli. Some may have been more prominent at a past stage of our life than now, but they lie just below the surface still. Whenever we are fatigued, stressed, or whenever conscious control is lessened, these old patterns are especially prone to reactivation.

Go ahead, defend that child as one should, but do not give it the power of choice in your adult life. Remember that the place of origin for all these patterns is (1) in the traumatic past, (2) from the disempowered world of the child, and (3) confined within the limited range of choices and values of that world.

What we are seeing is sometimes called the “provisional personality,” the acquired behaviors, attitudes, and reflexive strategies through which we learned to manage the world the best we could.

• For a 40-card deck, if you really want to have a land that produces a certain color of mana in your opening hand, you should play at least nine or ten lands that produce that color (eleven to be safe). • For a 60-card deck, you should play at least fifteen or sixteen lands that produce that color (seventeen or eighteen to be safe).

HOW MANY LANDS TO PLAY Traditional knowledge is that lands should make up a touch over 40% of a deck. This means about 17–18 lands for a 40-card deck and about 24–25 lands for a 60-card deck. This is a tried-and-true structure that's worked for many players for many years. You'll rarely be making a big mistake if you always stick to such a guideline. That said, there are a number of factors that might make you consider small adjustments.

Job experiences a revelation, a transformation of perspective, and declares that his widely proclaimed piety was based on a hubristic assumption that his compliant behavior compelled God to treat him well. Job realizes that there is no deal, that such a deal is a presumption of the ego in service to its now familiar agenda, which promotes its own security, satiety, and continuity.

We can see that the agenda of the first half of life is predominantly a social agenda framed as “How can I enter this world, separate from my parents, create relationships, career, social identity?” Or put another way: “What does the world ask of me, and what resources can I muster to meet its demands?” But in the second half of life, the worm turns, the agenda shifts to reframing our personal experience in the larger order of things, and the questions change. “What does the soul ask of me?” “What does it mean that I am here?” “Who am I apart from my roles, apart from my history?”

If we stop running and turn to these questions, renewal, not defeat, emerges and we grow larger, often against our will. After all, who or what is asking these questions? If they are not asked by the ego, or presented by our culture, they must be asked by the soul.

The music of the trees, too, tuning the wind. She remembers. Her nose slips into one of those dark fissures between the flat terra-cotta plates. She falls into the smell, a devastating whiff of two hundred million years ago. She can’t imagine what such perfume was ever meant to do. But it does something to her now. Mind control. It’s neither vanilla nor turpentine, but replete with highlights of each. A shot of spiritual butterscotch. A sprig of pineapple incense. It smells like nothing but itself, pungent and sublime.

Wisdom begins when we recognize that there are these split-off parts of the personality that have a life of their own. They rob energy from our conscious life, oblige us to serve historic patterns rather than be in the present with all choices open, and bind us, like the mythic Ixion, to the wheel of repetition. Until we bring these fragments of charged history to consciousness, dialogue with them, and observe them at work in our lives, we can never create our lives as we wish them to be.

TURN ON THE CAR RADIO tomorrow morning, to something other than the local news or sports station. Listen to the music. What is it about invariably? Why, “love,” of course, and the search for the one who will make your life work. Is that not the deepest of our fantasies, the one that infiltrates so many other levels of our lives? Is not the hope that we can find him or her who will make it right, who will heal our history, who will really be there for us and resolve our strongest private need?

Since all insistent, obsessive desires are first fueled by an anxiety of some sort, what then is the hidden agenda behind our preoccupation with relationships? Of all the ideologies that possess the contemporary soul, perhaps none is more powerful, more seductive, and possibly more delusory than the romantic fantasy that there is someone out there who is right for us, the long-sought soul mate, what I call “the magical other,” the one who will truly understand us, take care of us, meet our needs, repair the wounds, and, with a little luck, spare us the burden of growing up and meeting our own needs.

This fantasy is in us all, and is the most virulent ideology of the modern world, even more powerful than its chief rival: the fantasy that material goods will bring us happiness. Perhaps the combination of romance and affluence are surrogates for belief in God.

At least two psychodynamic stratagems are present in all relationships, at all times, though in varying degrees, namely projection and transference, phenomena therapists are trained to identify, but as fellow human beings we are no more inoculated against their toxins than the next person.

All relationships begin in projection. While each moment is wholly new, one of the ways in which we are able to function without having to reinvent ourselves over and over is to reflexively impose past experience, agenda, and understandings onto each new person, each new situation. These are projections. Unfortunately, as we look to each new situation, each new person through the lens of the old, we risk compromising its unique character with our historic experience and distorting its essential reality in service to the unfinished agendas of the past. And as projection is an essentially unconscious phenomenon, we do not know that we are externalizing our internal experience onto the other person.

The second psychological mechanism employed in relationships is transference. As historically charged creatures, we have a tendency to transfer those historical patterns, and their predictable outcomes, into every new relationship. Fundamental values are always brought into the new setting and impose themselves on the relationship: attraction/repulsion; love/hate; passivity/aggression; trust/distrust; approach/avoidance; intimacy/distance; and many others. As one has experienced the primal relationships of childhood, so those core ideas and reflexive strategies, with their predictable outcomes, are brought into the present.

If projection recognizes a familiar profile in the other, a set of characteristics that derive from us not them, then transference is the script, the old drama, the programmed repetition that is most likely to follow that projection. Initially, we are incapable of recognizing that we are experiencing the other person reflexively through the refracting screen of our personal psychologies.

“What do we project, and what do we transfer onto the other person?” What is projected and transferred most is our intrapsychic imago as charged and programmed by our history. An imago is a very deeply charged image. An image becomes an imago when it activates an archetypal energy field, and thereby touches on not just this present occasion, but activates our whole history as well. Our intrapsychic imago of the beloved other will most commonly have been shaped by our most primal experiences of relationships. This imago most likely derives from our experience of our parents, although other experiences, traumatic or healing, can affect this primal data.

Because of the magnitude of the parent/child relationship—since every child’s sensibility is so dependent, so malleable, and so unaware of alternatives—these archaic, childhood messages about self and world have enormous purchase on our souls, and astonishing staying power.

Summary of the Basic Practice Sit down, close your eyes, and go through the Six Point Preparation for Meditation: Motivation, Goals, Expectations, Diligence, Distractions, and Posture. Then, do the Four-Step Transition, gradually restricting the natural movements of your attention as you move from one Step to the next. The transition needs to be gentle and gradual. Emphasize relaxation, peacefulness, and pleasure, rather than willpower and effort. When you reach Step Four and you’re focusing on the breath at the nose, stabilize your attention by counting five or ten breaths without interruption. When you’re finished counting, keep attending to the sensations of the breath at the nose.

The story says then that when we put a part of ourselves in the bag it regresses. It de-evolves toward barbarism. Suppose a young man seals a bag at twenty and then waits fifteen or twenty years before he opens it again. What will he find? Sadly, the sexuality, the wildness, the impulsiveness, the anger, the freedom he put in have all regressed; they are not only primitive in mood, they are hostile to the person who opens the bag. The man who opens his bag at forty-five or the woman who opens her bag rightly feels fear. She glances up and sees the shadow of an ape passing along the alley wall; anyone seeing that would be frightened.

What we call here a Black Swan (and capitalize it) is an event with the following three attributes. First, it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility. Second, it carries an extreme impact (unlike the bird). Third, in spite of its outlier status, human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it explainable and predictable.

It is helpful to recognize a number of common speech patterns that tend to mask accountability for our own feelings: 1. Use of impersonal pronouns such as it and that: “It really infuriates me when spelling mistakes appear in our public brochures.” “That bugs me a lot.” 2. The use of the expression “I feel (an emotion) because … “ followed by a person or personal pronoun other than I: “I feel hurt because you said you don’t love me.” “I feel angry because the supervisor broke her promise.” 3. Statements that mention only the actions of others: “When you don’t call me on my birthday, I feel hurt.” “Mommy is disappointed when you don’t finish your food.

Create your Tasks through the lens of curiosity rather than by giving yourself commands or ultimatums. It’s the difference between “Lose weight!” and “What one unhealthy thing could I remove from my diet?” Our minds respond well to questions because we’re problem solvers. You can engage your curiosity by asking yourself questions to spark your imagination: What do I want to do? Why do I want to do it? What small thing can I do right now to get started? Keeping your questions small helps the resulting Tasks remain manageable. The harder the Task, the more effort it will require and the more likely you’ll be to put it off. Make the Tasks as effortless as possible. You can also apply this technique if you come to a standstill in your project. Even if you’re held up by something or someone, chances are there’s still an action you can take to keep the project moving forward. Ask yourself questions such as: What small step can I take now to move this forward? What could I improve now? It might be something as simple as researching relevant information on the internet, asking a few questions of a knowledgeable friend or colleague, recalibrating your Sprints, or writing a long-form entry in your notebook about what you’ve learned so far.

If you’re not happy with your life, then ask yourself, What tiny thing could I do tomorrow that would make my life a little bit better? Perhaps it’s calling a friend, leaving a few minutes early to take the scenic route to work on a fine day, or tackling the chair that’s drowning in your clothes.

The next time you cross off a Task in your BuJo, slow down. Take a moment to pause and reflect on the impact of your accomplishment. What do you feel? If by chance you feel nothing—or maybe nothing but relief—then chances are the thing you’re working so diligently toward isn’t adding much value to your life. That’s a critical insight that needs to be recognized. If on the other hand you feel even a small sense of joy, pride, appreciation, or fulfillment, then you may be onto something. Gift yourself a moment to appreciate your accomplishment and acknowledge it, because it’s trying to reveal something to you. After all, if you can’t appreciate your achievements, then what’s the point?!

This is a practical guide. It is therefore designed to be used in conjunction with practical exercises, geared to take one to the level of experience at which the later explanations become comprehensible. Reading ahead may be of no help, unless you have significant experience of silent sitting in a Buddhist tradition. If you do not have such experience, reading ahead may merely fuel preconceptions with regard to experiences before you have had the opportunity of discovering them for yourself. Reading ahead will preclude opportunities for gaining fresh experience—as distinct from preempted experience.

This brings us back to the Tibetan adage: Meditation isn’t; getting used to is. When it is said that meditation isn’t, what is signified is that meditation is not a method of doing. It is a method of notdoing. One does not involve oneself in doing anything. One does not instigate anything or impose anything. One does not add anything or elaborate anything. One simply remains. One simply maintains presence in motiveless observation. When it is said that getting used to is, what is signified is a practice in which one is simply getting used to being. One acclimatizes oneself to the undefined dimension of existence. We are unused to our own enlightenment, so meditation is a way of “getting used to” it. In terms of deep-rooted attachment to thought, one is getting used to nonreferentiality. One is getting used to being referenceless.

In meditation, you stop and exit the car. You sit on the ground on a grassy verge overlooking the highway, and watch cars go by. You are aware of the earth beneath you and the sky above you. You see cars moving past – but do not jump into any of them. Cars in a constant stream appear around a bend, hurtle past, and disappear into the distance. You remain by the side of the road, watching. There is nothing you need to do and nowhere you need to go. No car is any more significant than any other. You just enjoy the sunshine and the sensation of the immovable earth beneath you. Check your experience over the next week: is meditation like that?

Another analogy: Thoughts are like cars on a highway. Usually, you are in a car, carried along in the flow of traffic – sometimes fast, sometimes slow, sometimes smooth, sometimes caught in jerky stop-and-go congestion. In meditation, you stop and exit the car. You sit on the ground on a grassy verge overlooking the highway, and watch cars go by. You are aware of the earth beneath you and the sky above you. You see cars moving past – but do not jump into any of them. Cars in a constant stream appear around a bend, hurtle past, and disappear into the distance.

We wrongly suppose that meditation is boring because there is nothing to do. It is, in fact, only boring when we stuff boring thoughts into the emptiness. If you can face emptiness squarely and stare into it – you will not find boredom there. When you break through the self-imposed barrier of boredom—the terror of nothing happening—you discover the vast brilliant space of unlimited creative potential. If you are fully present in your attention – experience is never boring.

What we call here a Black Swan (and capitalize it) is an event with the following three attributes. First, it is an outlier, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility. Second, it carries an extreme impact (unlike the bird). Third, in spite of its outlier status, human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it explainable and predictable.

When thoughts come – let them come. When thoughts go – let them go. If you find yourself involved in a stream of thoughts, let go of your involvement with them. Keep letting go of involvement. Remain uninvolved. Just let go. Whatever happens – let it be as it is. If you feel good – do not hold on to those positive thoughts. If you feel bad – do not reject those negative thoughts. Especially important: if you feel nothing in particular – do not drift into numbness and lack of presence. Remain alert.

The subject of each file was the same: Tristan Huxley. Milton went over to the coffee machine, slipped a capsule into the top and put a mug beneath the nozzle. He pressed the button, and the machine bubbled and chugged as it prepared his drink. Milton opened the dossier that summarised Huxley’s career and read. Huxley’s background was much less auspicious than might have been expected if one were to judge him by the lifestyle he led today. He was born in Manchester in 1964 and grew up in a normal, nondescript family.

the history of Rus’ too. It can best  be seen in how the names of Rus’ princes were changing. The first two generations had Scandinavian names: the dynasty founder was Rurik (Eric), his son – Ihor (Ingvar), and Ihor’s wife – Olha (Helga). Instead, the names of the two first Christianized princes – Volodymyr and Yaroslav – were Slavic. The time of their rule (980-1019) is, at the same time, the period of the supreme greatness of Rus’. After Yaroslav’s death, Rus entered the period of feudal fragmentation and internecine wars, and in 1240 it became prey for new nomads who came from far-off Mongolia. "Ukrainian, Russian and, to a lesser extent, Belarusian historians, debate whose national state ancient Rus’ actually was: Russian, Ukrainian or Belarusian. This dispute is senseless."   In the same way you can discuss whose st
